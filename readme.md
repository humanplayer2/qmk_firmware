# Trackpoint support

- Trackpoint is treated as a pointing devices, by including PS/2 in Pointing Devices, by (this PR)[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/22532].
- Pointing Devices does not support `PS2_MOUSE_SCROLL_BTN_MASK` for scrolling.
- Trackpoint scrolling using `KC_BTN3` works out-of-the-box via Linux drivers if the keyboard name ends with `Trackpoint`.
    - Alternatively, the `SCROLL` implementation introduced in (this commit)[https://github.com/humanplayer2/qmk_firmware/commit/6c21090f35c127b8988990911239ec8c429a41d9] also worked for scrolling.
